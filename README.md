Doug Crockford wrote some JavaScript functions, referenced [here]( http://www.crockford.com/javascript/little.js), which would let a JS programmer do the exericses in [_The Little Schemer_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/) in JS.

This project will port that to TypeScript.
